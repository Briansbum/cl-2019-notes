####Steps to having fun and potentially increasing performance by 31%:

0.5.  Stop prohibiting fun
1.  Find the unfun things and get rid of them

    * Are you spending less than 50% of your time programming?

    * @jesslynnrose <-- good tweets

    * Schedule pair programming to block meetings

    * #noestimates
    I like this hashtag

    * TDD is fun, it's also easily gamified, it pretty much is a game already

    * Automate boring things


2.  Add fun!

    *   Breaks with exercise are a good thing.

    *   Can our job be fun? Sure, ops is fun puzzle time and programming is similar

    *   Gamification can help to turn goals into prizes

    *   This example was given:
    A team was promised 1 free lunch for increasing test coverage by a certain amount and 10 years of tech debt was resolved in a month (I think, could have been another amount of time)


3.  Gamification is such a good reward it will make people rush or do wrong things intentionally to get the reward

    *   Tell people you're gamifing their work so that they don't feel tricked when you provide the reward.

    *   Mandatory fun:
        *  People don't like mandatory fun
        *  How do you know you're having fun if you're not measuring it?
        *  How to ruin an office party? Take attendance
