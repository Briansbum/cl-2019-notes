# Notes from Continuous Lifecycle 2019
##### Sessions I took halfway decent notes for
Some are more edited than others, a lot are spellchecked stream of consciousness type deals because I was listening.

**Session 1:**
Why container security isn't about security of containers

**Session 3:**
Continuous infrastructure first

**Session 4:**
Journey to smaller containers

**Session 5:**
