"you don't need SRE unless you're google"

The evolutions of ops
ops -> devops -> sre

These awful names are okay because naming things is hard

Ops people doing Devops are calling themselves SRE's because they don't want to be called Devops because that's silly

SRE practices made working life more efficient and nicer for Pivotal's cloudOps team

"The wellbeing of human operators impacts the reliability of systems"

(https://landing.google.com/sre/book)

"SRE is what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations"

SRE accepts that failure is normal and needs to be prepared for, preparation won't stop failure happening but will make it less frequent and less painful

Read the SRE books, most of this talk is in there. They're great books.

maslow's hierarchy comes up for the 3rd time. I'm assuming that seeing as I've been going to 1/3rd of these sessions that it's actually come up 9 times across the conference so far
